# Difference
# To find differences in the elements in both sets. The elements that donâ€™t exist in one set will be returned if we consider them with respect to the second set.


set1 = {2,4,6,8,10}
set2 = {4,6,8,12,14}
  
# Difference of two sets
# using difference() function
new_set = set1.difference(set2)
  
print(new_set)
